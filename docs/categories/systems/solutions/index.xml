      <description>Because every Mad (Computer) Scientist needs their Hardware Wall-Mounted!
I put together this computer largely from spare parts and Amazon points from my Amex. So barely cost anything, and I thought it would be perfect as a server for Zoneminder.
This was built with the intention of putting it in an enclosure. It started out sitting on my bookshelf, where I used some half-inch standoffs to raise it up. Here&amp;rsquo;s a pic:</description>

CDC Controller GPIO Inputs: The CDC controller has 8 GPIO inputs as shown in the above picture:</description>
